The device shown in Figure 1 (A-C) is a lowcost, wireless data acquisitions system designed for the following applications: (i) Pump and sensor control in a temperature and humidity-controlled incubator for cell culture studies and (ii) Remote data acquisition and system diagnostics in refrigeration and air conditioning units. For cell-culture applications in incubators, this system integrated a dosing pump (Model: EZO-PMP, Atlas Scientific) capable of delivering very small dosages (in the micro- liters per minute range) of cell media by varying parameters such as flow rate, pump frequency, and total volume dispensed. These parameters were customizable to the requirements of cell-inoculated scaffolds and culturing protocols. Concurrently, real-time data was acquired from pH, conductivity, and temperature measurement sensors. For environmental diagnostic applications, barometric pressures and temperatures will be monitored using the same system with appropriate sensors. The data transfer was achieved through UART, SPI, and I2C protocols that allow both reading and writing functionality from sensors and instrumentation. The system was controlled using a smartphone-based RESTful API that communicated with the WiFi-enabled microcontroller mounted on the SBC (Raspberry Pi 3B+).",
