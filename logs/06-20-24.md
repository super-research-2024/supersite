SSH is now working on the Jetson, and the rest of the team is able to connect remotely, making it much easier to work on the Jetson. This not only bypasses the need for dealing with the Jetson's slow interface, but now we can have separate directories on the Jetson for different projects. 

The Mosquitto MQTT broker is also now running on the Jetson. Further testing to determine the integrity of the protocol still has to be done, specifically, how the broker reacts to a power loss, dropped connections, and external machines connecting. However, this is a strong foundation, which I have protected by implementing user authentication and client certificates. 

A listening instance can be created with `mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test -u "username" -P "password"` and a writing instance can be created with `mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test "message" -u "username" -P "password"`

Instructions for setting this up can be found [here](https://medium.com/gravio-edge-iot-platform/how-to-set-up-a-mosquitto-mqtt-broker-securely-using-client-certificates-82b2aaaef9c8).
