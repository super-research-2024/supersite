### Wednesday, June 5

The homepage of the website is 80% done. The project title, contributors, and description is added and styled as well as a rough draft of the menu bar. The remaining 20% is a bit more styling, bug fixes concerning the 'About' drop down menu and the image not loading. These should be fixed by the end of the week since they don't take high priority for site functionality. 

For the menu bar, I used the hstack (Horizontal Stack) component in Pynecone to list buttons horizontally that link to each page. Currently, the About button is just that, but I am trying to get it so that it lists each member involved on mouse hover (as seen in the commented out version of that pc.link, lines 32 - 47). 

The rest of the page is styled with a vstack which contains headings and text elements, all styled with Pynecone props. The project description would have been read from the text file in the assets directory, but Pynecone doesn't allow for the use of for loops inside a fragment. This is something I'd like to look into later when cleaning up the code. 

Tomorrow's goal is to get the devlog page done. This will be the bulk of the website and will likely require another python file to parse through the markdown files.
