### Tuesday, June 18

Today, the Jetson was upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04. This wasn't a straightforward process, since the default installation process resulted in the system image becoming bricked. Here is how I got around this:

1. Set the "Prompt" variable to "normal" in `/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades` to enable distrubution upgrades
2. Update the system and run `apt-get dist-upgrade`, then restart the system. 
3. Upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 with `sudo do-release-upgrade` and return the default values of all the prompts...*this takes several hours*
4. Once the upgrade is done and it prompts for a restart, do not restart. 
5. Set the "WaylandEnable" variable to "false" in `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf` to get rid of the black screen at boot
6. Uncomment the line `Driver   "nvidia"` in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`
7. Reset the upgrade manager to `never `
8. Reboot the system and it should now boot up normally

There are some other tweaks that can be done once Ubuntu 20 boots up, which can be found in Q-engineering's blog [here](https://qengineering.eu/install-ubuntu-20.04-on-jetson-nano.html). 

I also had a meeting with Professsor Bulusu to discuss the current memebers and their roles over the next few weeks.
