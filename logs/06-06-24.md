### Thursday, June 6

My goal for the log page is to have all log files displayed in a list of clickable cards. The cards will show the date and the person who entered the log and a preview of the log itself. Once the log is clicked, it will take the user to a dynamically rendered log page which displays the full log entry. 

I am able to display all of the logs on the page, but Pynecone has a very specific way to manipulate state elements and very little documentation on the topic. I am trying to update the log_name state variable with the clicked log, but this is still not working. 

The issue I am currently facing is instead of trying to set a state element, I am trying to have a function called when the button is clicked to update a global variable using on_click, which is expecting an event to be returned. I will continue to debug this tomorrow.

All changes are saved in the 'log-functionality' branch to avoid issues with the main branch.
