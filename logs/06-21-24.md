Now that SSH and MQTT protocols are setup and working on the Jetson, I was able to an Apache 2 web server.

The first step was to configure the UFW firewall and to make sure that SSH connections were allowed in addition to port ___ to allow for web server connections. I had some issues with setting the firewall to start on system boot since I was connected to the Jetson via SSH. This was fixed by simply enabling it locally on the Jetson. 

Apache2 is also now set up and running, however, we will need to purchase a domain before being able to host the website. Instructions for setting up Apache are [here.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-22-04)
