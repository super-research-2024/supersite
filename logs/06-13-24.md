With the website's basic functionality now working, it was time to begin working on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Professor Kartik Bulusu and I worked on finding a 3D printable housing for the Jetson. We chose the design linked below given it's strong standoffs and easy to assemble design.

Tomorrow's goal is to begin installing and updating the necessary libraries and software on the Jetson to prepare it for MQTT. Our end goal is to have the Jetson host the website as well as serve as the broker for the MQTT network between the Raspberry Pi's.
