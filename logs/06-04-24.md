### Tuesday, June 4

After blood, sweat, and lots of tears, the Pynecone dev environment is now set up. 

Pynecone docs can be found here: https://docs.pynecone.io/

The app can be run in dev mode with `pc run` and in debug mode with `pc run --loglevel debug`. 
Make sure you have pynecone installed and Node.js 16.8.0 or higher. 

Pynecone uses a page system that allows us to do fullstack development all in Python with many premade elements which are then converted into Javascript pages. The js files can be found in web/pages/.
The web directory can be left alone but can be useful for debugging. 

My goals for tomorrow include setting up a homepage with our project description and goals.
My goal for the end of the week is to have these logs to be visible on the website. 

### From Pynecone docs: 
*You can export your app's frontend and backend to zip files using the `pc export` command.* 

*The front end is a compiled NextJS app, which can be deployed to a static hosting service like **GitHub Pages** or Vercel. However, this is just a static build, so you will need to deploy the backend separately. See the self-hosting guide for more information.*
