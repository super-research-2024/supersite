### Monday, June 17

A new Micro SD card was ordered and installed into the Jetson today, since we were running out of storage on the previous 32GB card. This meant flashing a new version of Ubuntu packaged from NVIDIA's website. 

This meant having to reinstall all of the necessary packages. First steps were to upgrade Ubuntu to version 20.04, since this is required for Node.js 16.x or higher,  (which we need to host and run this website).

Next steps include installing Node.js, setting the correct versions of Python in the virtual environments used for the website and the MQTT server.

The new Ubuntu version install took most of the day today, so these steps will be done tomorrow.

See the Log #7 (06-14-24) for the list of packages that were installed.
