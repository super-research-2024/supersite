## What I did:

I spoke with Nate yesterday (06-11-24) regarding issues with getting the logs to display on the webpage and worked on some form of a solution. Due to the abstracted form of almost all the data in the pynecone framework the access to variables during runtime is somewhat difficult to navigate. I began with encapsulating all "global" variables into the State class for easy manipulation. Also, all log *names* and *ids* intially present in the /logs directory at runtime are loaded into log_dict, and the contents of the individual logs are loaded into logs. Pre-loading all of the logs elimated the issues both Nate and I were running into. With this, I also added functionality to check periodically (upon each load of the /devlog page) for new logs entered into the /logs directory allowing for real-time updates to the site. 

The original approach to displaying these logs consisted of multiple log/# routes where # was the log id. I instead opted to update the contents of the markdown component on a single route to match the log chosen by the user. This new approach would benefit from the utilization of dynamic routing (via url parameters) which is mentioned in the docs (pynecone.app/docs/components/pages). This would allow us to create customized urls for each log, making it easier to share and dynamically change each page - while only occupying a single route for the log-display functionality. 


## What still needs consideration:

I am sure there is a more concise way to combine the *logs_dict* and *logs* variables. As I said earlier, the logs would benefit from dynamic routing - with the current version clicking on log #1 would redirect to localhost:3000/logs/1 and display the proper information for that log. However copy/pasting the same url and changing the 1 to a 2 (localhost:3000/logs/2) would still only show the contents of log 1 as the program does not interpret url parameters. A minor addition, but overall good quality of life feature. 

I did not work on any sort of formatting for the log text, and thus that also needs some attention. The pc.markdown() component helps by directly formatting the markdown, however the component itself needs some work :)
