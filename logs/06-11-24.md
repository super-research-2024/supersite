### Tuesday, June 11

Today was spent working with Gustavo on trying to get a selected log to properly render on the page. The biggest issue is the way that Pynecone handles state variables.

For starters, Pynecone only allows JSON serializable variables to be stored as state variables since the python files are eventually translated to JavaScript. This means that not only are we limited to a primitive data types, we also can't perform most common Python functions on these data types. I also had a very hard time passing state variables between my own functions, since Pynecone wraps these variables into State objects and doesn't provide a .value attribute to access the value of the state variable.

We opted for a simpler approach, where log names, ids, and contents were preloaded into state variables instead of trying to dynamically load them as a log was clicked. This is not the most scalable solution, but works for the small amount of logs needed for this project. 

We want to get this part of the project up and working as soon as possible so we can move on to building out the infastructure tied to the NVIDIA Jetson - however, this will likely be revisted in the near future.
